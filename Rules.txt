1. Consent First – Always
Ask clearly and wait for enthusiastic yes before any touch, grab, RP, ERP, or NSFW interaction.  
Safeword: RED – everything stops instantly. No questions, no arguing.  
No means no. Uncomfortable = back off immediately. Pressuring, ignoring boundaries or guilt-tripping = instant kick/ban.

2. Respect Personal Space & Interactions  
No uninvited physical contact, pushing, flying into scenes, or blocking paths.  
If someone feels uncomfortable, speak up or call mods (Faron, Hoodbrailen & team).

3. Avatars & Behavior   
Lewd/NSFW avatars allowed.  
No crasher avatars.
No Avatars representing minors!
Try avoiding using avatars with a to high Vram usage.

4. Microphone & Communication   
No screaming, heavy breathing, or mic spam.   
English preferred (translate OOC if needed).

5. No Hate, Drama or Off-Topic   
Zero tolerance for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, slurs, or discrimination.  
No politics, religion, heavy arguments, or real-life drama.  
No advertising other worlds, servers, or groups without mod approval.

6. ERP Allowed Everywhere – With Consideration   ERP, yiff, and sexual interactions are permitted throughout the entire world (no forced SFW-only zones).  
Important rule: Do not ruin the overall mood or make groups / conversations uncomfortable.
→ If a group is chilling, talking casually, or doing something non-sexual → don't force lewdness into it or disrupt the vibe.
→ In calm / public areas, keep things more subtle / quieter / less invasive.
→ Loud moaning, sudden heavy lewdness, or crashing private conversations can still get mod intervention if it kills the atmosphere.
→ Be aware of the room's energy and respect it.

7. Mods & Final Decisions   Mods (Faron, Hoodbrailen & trusted team) have the last word – follow instructions immediately.  
No arguing rules in-world (DM for appeals or questions).  
Breaking VRChat ToS (harassment, illegal content, etc.) = automatic permanent ban.

Have fun, stay safe, and yiff responsibly!
